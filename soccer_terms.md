**Sideline**: The sides of the field designated by the touchline.

**Touchline**: The line surrounding the field of play, made up of the sidelines and the end lines.

## Offensive Play Instructions

**Cross**: A pass from near the touchlines that is directed towards the area in front of the goal. A cross is usually intended to be headed or volleyed with the foot into the goal by a teammate.

**Dribbling**: When a player runs with the ball at his or her feet, directing the ball with small, quick touches.

**Header**: When a player strikes or deflects the ball with his head to pass or shoot.

**Pass**: In soccer, a pass is when a player intentionally kicks, heads, or otherwise directs the ball to a teammate in order to maintain possession, advance play, or create a scoring opportunity.

**Shot**: A shot is any attempt to score by a team. The shot can result in a wide or high ball (over the goal), a keeper save, a deflection by another player or the post, or a goal. A shot is not necessarily a shot on goal.

**Shot on goal**: A shot on goal is any shot that results in a goal or a keeper save or a field player's block. All shots on goals count as shots, but not all shots are shots on goal.

**Space**: The open area on the field not occupied by players, which can be used by a team to create attacking opportunities or maintain possession.  Players often move into space to receive passes or to draw defenders away from key areas.

**Through ball**: A pass 'through' the defense into space intended for a teammate to run onto it.

**Overlap**: One player running past a teammate who has the ball, often on the wing, to receive a pass further up the field.

**Switch it**: Pass the ball to the other side of the field to open up the attack.

**Shoot**: Encourage players to take a shot on goal when they are in a good position to score.

**Man On**: To warn a teammate that an opponent is close behind them and they are about to be pressured.

**Time**: Indicates to the player with the ball that they have plenty of time and space to control it and make a decision.

**Play Wide**: Spread out to create more space on the field, typically involving players moving to the sidelines.

**Start Over**: Passing the ball backward to a supporting player away from pressure to restart the attack.

**Find Space**: Encourage players to move into open areas on the field to receive a pass or create an attacking opportunity.

**Support**: Reminds players to position themselves to offer options for the player with the ball.

## Defensive Play Instructions

**Defend**: To prevent the opponent from scoring.

**Pressure**: Tells a player to quickly close down the opponent with the ball.

**Cover**: To provide support for a teammate who is pressuring the ball.

**Goal Side**: Position the body between the opponent and the goal to prevent them from scoring.

**Mark Up**: Stick closely to an opposing player to prevent them from receiving the ball or making a play.

**Drop**: Instructs players to move towards their own goal to defend.

**Clear it**: Get the ball out of danger and away from the goal, usually by kicking it hard and far upfield.

**Jockey**: Stay between the opponent and the goal, slowing them down without committing to a tackle, allowing teammates to recover.

**Tackle**: Attempt to win the ball from an opponent.

## Play Stoppage

**Penalty kick**: A kick taken from in front of the goal, usually as a result of a foul that takes place inside the penalty area. When a penalty kick is taken, no player other than the shooter and opposing goalkeeper can enter the penalty area until after the shot is taken. Further, the goalkeeper cannot advance from the goal line until after the shot is taken, although the goalkeeper is allowed to move from side to side.

**Offside**: A violation that occurs when an offensive player is closer to the opponent's goal than both the ball and the second-to-last opposing player at the time that the ball is passed to the offensive player by his or her teammate. Players cannot be called offside if they are in their own half of the field or if they receive the ball from a throw-in, corner kick, or goal kick. When a player is called offside, the opposing team is awarded a free kick.

**Throw-in**: A way to restart play when the ball goes out over the sidelines. The team that did not last touch the ball last is allowed an overhead throw with a run-up from the sideline.

**Foul**: A stop in play when the referee judges a violation against an opposing player. The team that suffers the foul is awarded with a free kick unless the foul is committed by a defensive player inside his own penalty area, in which case the foul results in a penalty kick.

**Free kick**: A kick given to the team that has suffered a foul at the spot of the infraction. The kicker is given a ten-yard buffer between the spot of the kick and the first opposing player. A free kick is usually direct, meaning the kicker can score without the ball having to touch another player before it enters the goal. An indirect free kick is used for minor fouls in or near the penalty area that require the ball to touch another player before crossing the goal line.

**Corner kick**: Awarded when the defending team plays the ball over the end line, a corner kick is taken by the attacking team from next to the corner flag. Just as is the case with a free kick, the ball is kicked from a stopped position and defenders must be at least 10-yards away.

**Goal kick**: Awarded when the attacking team puts the ball over the end line, this is a set kick taken from the defending team's own goal box.
