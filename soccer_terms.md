## Offensive Play Instructions

**Cross**: A pass from near the touchlines that is directed towards the area in front of the goal. A cross is usually intended to be headed or volleyed with the foot into the goal by a teammate.

**Dribbling**: When a player runs with the ball at his or her feet, directing the ball with small, quick touches.

**Header**: When a player strikes or deflects the ball with his head to pass or shoot.

**Pass**: In soccer, a pass is when a player intentionally kicks, heads, or otherwise directs the ball to a teammate in order to maintain possession, advance play, or create a scoring opportunity.

**Shot**: A shot is any attempt to score by a team. The shot can result in a wide or high ball (over the goal), a keeper save, a deflection by another player or the post, or a goal. A shot is not necessarily a shot on goal.
